## {{ page.title }}

In computer science a queue is a data structure that is somewhat like a stack, except that in a queue the **first item inserted** is **the first to be removed** (First-In-First-Out, FIFO), while in a stack, as weâ€™ve seen, the **last item inserted** is the **first to be removed** (LIFO).

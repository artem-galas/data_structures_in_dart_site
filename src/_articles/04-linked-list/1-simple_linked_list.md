## {{ page.title }}

Here we're demonstrates a simple linked list. 

The only operations allowed in this version of a list are:
- Inserting an item at the beginning of the list
- Deleting the item at the beginning of the list
- Iterating through the list to display its contents

These operations are fairly easy to carry out, so weâ€™ll start with them.

```terminal
$ dart {{ page.file_path }}
```      

{% highlight dart %}
{% include_absolute examples/data_structures_in_dart/{{ page.file_path }} %}
{% endhighlight %}

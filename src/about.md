This project was inspired by great <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-2nd/dp/0672324539">book</a>.

As you know choose a right data structure and operate with it using right algoritm is one of the most importatnt skils for any developer. So I assume book, what I was mention above, and my examples should be usefull for you. 

You might have a question *"Why Dart?"*.

That because `Dart` is really similar to `Java` and much more easy. And it also crosplatform, so you can run example on MacOS, Windows or Linux.

Furthermore Dart is very powerfull language which can be use for <a href="https://webdev.dartlang.org/">Web</a>,
<a href="https://flutter.io/">Mobile</a>,
